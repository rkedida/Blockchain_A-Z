# Blockchain_A-Z

This repository contains a collection of three projects, providing a comprehensive view of the implementation of a Blockchain, a 
Cryptocurrency, and a Smart Contract. These are individual yet interconnected projects that bring together foundational blockchain concepts.

The projects in this repository are:

1. Module 1: Create a Blockchain - Proof of Work
   This module focuses on the basic implementation of a Blockchain using Python. It demonstrates the ability to mine new blocks, maintain a
   chain of blocks, and verify the integrity of the chain.

3. Module 2: Create a Cryptocurrency
   This module involves the creation of a basic cryptocurrency using blockchain technology. It includes the capability to mine new blocks,
   manage transactions, and network with other nodes.

3. Module 3: Create a Smart Contract
   This module contains a smart contract for a hypothetical Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a cryptocurrency known as "42Coin". It enables the
   purchase and sale of 42Coins and keeps track of an investor's equity in both USD and 42Coin.

## Technologies Used
- Python

- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.

- hashlib: Python's secure hash and message digest module.

- JSON: Lightweight data-interchange format.

- datetime: Python's module to work with dates and times.

- Solidity: Ethereum's programming language for creating smart contracts.

- Ganache: Personal blockchain for Ethereum development used for deploying contracts, developing applications, and running tests.

- MyEtherWallet: A free, client-side interface for creating Ethereum wallets.

- requests: HTTP library for Python

- uuid: Python's module to generate universally unique identifiers

Each module has its own README file that provides more detailed information about its features, the technologies used, setup instructions, and 
more.
