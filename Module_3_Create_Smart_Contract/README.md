# Create a Smart Contract

This repository contains a smart contract for a hypothetical Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a cryptocurrency known as "42Coin".

The contract was written in Solidity, the object-oriented programming language for Ethereum. 

It enables the purchase and sale of 42Coins, as well as keeps track of an investor's equity in both USD and 42Coin.



# Features
- Buying and selling of 42Coin

- Tracking equity of investors in 42Coin and USD

- Conversion rate between USD and 42Coin

- Ensuring an investor does not buy more 42Coins than the maximum supply

# Technologies Used
- Solidity: Solidity is Ethereum's programming language for creating smart contracts.

- Ganache: Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development used for deploying contracts, developing applications, and running tests.

- MyEtherWallet: A free, client-side interface for creating Ethereum wallets.

# Setup & Deployment
## Prerequisites
- Solidity Compiler version 0.4.11 or similar

- Ganache for a personal Ethereum blockchain

- MyEtherWallet or similar to interact with the blockchain


## Steps
1. Compile the contract using Solidity compiler (solc).

2. Start Ganache to initialize a personal Ethereum blockchain.

3. Use MyEtherWallet to deploy the contract on the blockchain. You can use the bytecode generated by the Solidity compiler for deployment.

## Testing

You can test the contract functionalities using Ganache and MyEtherWallet.

1. Start Ganache and note down the RPC server (usually HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545).

2. Go to MyEtherWallet and connect it to Ganache's RPC server.

3. Deploy the contract to the Ganache blockchain using MyEtherWallet.

4. After deployment, call the buy_42Coin and sell_42Coin functions from MyEtherWallet and validate the results by checking the balances on Ganache.

5.Test equity_in_42Coin and equity_in_usd functions for your add
